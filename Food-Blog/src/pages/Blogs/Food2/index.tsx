                Marinate the Chicken:
<br />
In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with red chili powder, turmeric powder, salt, and lemon juice. Let it marinate for at least 15-30 minutes.<br/>
Add salt, the black lime if using, and enough water to cover the chicken. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked through and tender. This can take 30-40 minutes.<br />
<br />
Cook the Chicken:
<br />
Heat the coconut oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat.<br />
Add the marinated chicken and sear it on all sides until it's lightly browned. This will take about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.<br />
<br />
Prepare the Gravy:
<br />
In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Add fennel seeds and allow them to splutter.<br />
Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn soft and translucent.<br />
Add minced garlic, ginger, green chilies, and curry leaves. Sauté for a couple of minutes until they become fragrant..<br />
Add coriander powder and cumin powder. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the raw aroma disappears<br />
Return the seared chicken to the pan and mix it with the spice-onion mixture.<br />
Add chopped tomatoes and continue to cook until they turn soft and mushy.<br />
Pour in the thick coconut milk and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Ensure the chicken is fully submerged in the coconut milk.<br />
Cover the pan and let it simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the gravy thickens. Stir occasionally.<br />
