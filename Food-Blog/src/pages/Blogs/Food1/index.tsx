Prepare the Chicken:
<br />
In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil and sauté the chopped onions until they become translucent.<br />
Add the minced garlic and continue to cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant.<br />
Add the Mandi spice mix and sauté for a few more minutes to enhance the flavors.<br />
Add the chicken pieces and cook until they start to brown.<br />
Add salt, the black lime if using, and enough water to cover the chicken. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked through and tender. This can take 30-40 minutes.<br />
<br />
Prepare the Rice:
<br />
Wash the Basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 15-20 minutes.<br />
In a separate pot, heat ghee (or vegetable oil) and sauté the thinly sliced onions until they become golden brown and crispy. Remove half of these onions and set them aside for garnish.<br />
Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot with the remaining onions. Sauté for a few minutes until the rice is coated with ghee and the onions.<br />
Add the saffron milk and salt. Stir gently to mix the saffron and salt evenly.<br />
Pour in the 4 cups of water, bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed. This typically takes about 15-20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Assemble the Chicken Mandi:
<br />
Arrange the cooked rice on a serving platter or a large tray.<br />
Place the cooked chicken on top of the rice.<br />
Garnish with the reserved crispy onions.<br />
You can also serve it with a side of yogurt mixed with cucumber and mint, and a tomato and cucumber salad.<br />
Chicken Mandi is known for its smoky, aromatic flavors. Traditionally, it's cooked in a tandoor or a pit in the ground, giving it a distinct smoky flavor. However, you can achieve a similar smokiness by adding a small piece of charcoal heated until it's red-hot to the pot when you're simmering the chicken, along with a little ghee. This will infuse a smoky flavor into the dish.<br />
